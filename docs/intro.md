# Intro

I haven't met anyone till date whose' childhood dream was to become a software developer.
But as we grow up we realize this *pays* well.

I am a Javascript fan. Why? Is that because it's fancy ? No, I know Java too. Infact I am Oracle Certified Java developer. Is the reason its easy to learn? No python has much easier learning curve. Then why? 

'Write once run anywhere'. - you would have heard this for Java right? Wrong - Java doest run in browser. Javascript do. 
In browser and everywhere else.

Web, App, Server - all can host codebase in same language (JS) - bringing your development cost & headache down.

Remember those days of 2000's when PC used to have tons of softwares for different purposes like browser, music player, video player, ms office, adobe suite etc - all of these are comfortably knocked down by something like chromeos or just a laptop with chrome on it.

back to present - Aren't the mobile phones of today are same thing as desktops of yesterday and apps same things as old softwares , what do you think is gonna happen next. History repeats itself. I already have web version of Amazon, OYO , Myntra installed in my phone as apps, and they **feel** better than native apps.


Web is powerful, Javascript is it's fuel.
