# Usability Engineering

   Usability engineering is like designing a cookie jar for someone who's not quite awake yet and wants a biscuit with their morning tea. You want to make sure the jar lid is easy to open, the cookies are easy to reach, and the jar doesn't accidentally spill cookies all over . It's all about making things so simple and easy to use that even a half-asleep person can enjoy their tea and biscuits without any challenge
