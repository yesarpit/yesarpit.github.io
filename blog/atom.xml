        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Backwards Law, coined by philosopher Alan Watts, is the belief that often you need to do the opposite of what you believe to get the result you desire. In many situations, struggling and pushing makes the situation worse, where stepping back can improve things. </p><p>Alan Watts was a British writer who took Eastern philosophy and translated it for the Western world.
He once wrote, “wanting a positive experience is a negative experience; accepting a negative experience is a positive experience”. This was referred to as ‘The Backwards Law’ – the idea that the more you pursue feeling better all the time, the less satisfied you become. Pursuing something reinforces the fact that you lack it in the first place</p>]]></content>

Distributed practice
Reasearch has shown that when learning is distributed uniformly across week brings more learning.

Reasearch shows taking practice test aftrer chapters is more effective than revising
Also you can find a study partner and ask questions to each other.</p></blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>Inter leaved practice
Mixing several types of items while practicing . Block practicing - example in badminton if you try different types of serve instead of just doing one service at time brings better results in long term
Elaborative intervention

We all grew together we have no barriers but as we grow older we start noticing differences.</p><p>as a result of all this I am not able to connect
Animal confirm what you think about them what kind of barriers you have about them so keep your mind open while meeting
They will feel the connection immediately</p><p>Show love and surrender ego</p><p>Give your 110% while talking to anyone, they know how you are making them feel.
Everybody wants to be heard, respected, followed.</p><p>Communication is made of :
5% words
37% tone and influction
50% body and face language</p><p>1)  Stop assumptions - fact and figures are must required. Don't blabber anything.
2)  Use easy language - simplify , avoid bookish language  ( trump's speech was very easy - was able to understand by 4th class kids)
3) Right use of body language -  body speaks before words
a) 50-70 rule for eye contact
b) don't shake legs - show's nervousness
c) smile is non verbal communication
d) Control your voice pitch - avoid high and too low
4) Take a pause in your conversation, so that others can understand
5) Don't use failure words - hmm, actually, obviously, you know etc</p><p>#learnings</p>]]></content>
