## Ego is the Enemy
All people are in these three stages 
1) Aspire 2) Success 3) failure

Like happiness and sad is seen on face
Ego is seen in behavior

Aspire:Like gov exam preprare, etc
This is most tough - as its exciting and tough( it easy to do big task)
Silence is rare: jyada bolne aur sochne se energy waste hoti he

PEOPLE DONT CARE about you as much as you think


You cant build a Reputation based on what you ae going to do -Henry Ford

when you are not practicing - some else is .
Think less do more - via action

2) Success
If you cant swallow your pride, you cant lead
Its hard to stay at top

Keep your identity small
Never think about your money, property , fame or position - keep doing what brought you here

Its important to be humble

3) Failure
Its normal to fail 
ALive time - when you are learning
Dead time - when you are not learning

Talent === sweeping (you need to sweep floor daily otherwise it will be dirty similarly you need to practise skills daily)
