Explicit:

Exercise and Meditation helps


Do important things first

Keep a distraction log- remember what distract you - becoming aware of what distracts you


Reference memory:


Green tea black tea and breath- alpha memory ( concentration )

Theta memory - 2 to 5years child - extraordinary learning

Set goal regular for dopamine release which will help you learn

Deadlines: many nd short

Each deadline you miss if you 

Cold showers it Increase dopamine level by 250% and 500% noradrenaline

Vary exercise and push your limits for great endorphins release


Start singletasking

A day without setting goal is a day when you are not operating your best

+Optimal learning strategy

>>80/20
20 percentage of action leads to 80percent result

>>Parkinson's law
Works expands to fill the time given
 
Set Tight deadlines are necessary to get best out of you

>> Blooms taxonomy
School learning system is failing

Creating - is the most efficient way to learn something followed by 
Evaluating, 
Analyzing,
Applying,
Understanding
Remember (passive Learning, bad approach)

>>Behavioursm
Surrounding yourself with talented and knowledgeable person

>>Conitivismks
Find connection between what you know and new learning helps strengthen neuro transmitters
Develop your mindset, common people think they can't be good at maths, but its not correct
Keep reading and learning makes you strong

>>Constructivism
Passive reading and listening to video is not efficient way of learning, create something out of your learning : most impotant - start with complex problem and on the way to resolve that learn basics

>> Distributed practice
Reasearch has shown that when learning is distributed uniformly across week brings more learning.
You need to space out your practice session across days intead of all at once in one day
>>Practice test
Reasearch shows taking practice test aftrer chapters is more effective than revising
Also you can find a study partner and ask questions to each other.

>> Inter leaved practice
Mixing several types of items while practicing . Block practicing - example in badminton if you try different types of serve instead of just doing one service at time brings better results in long term
>>Elaborative intervention
Ask why intead of what
The more learning hooks you create more space will form for new learning

>>Self explanattion
Explain to yourself with efforts. So that brai. Can remember it.explain to urself as if prac

>> Lifetayle
Improve sleep quality

>> Excerise
Balances neurotransmitter
Increase brain volume
Smoking= sitting
Walking+ audiobooks great combination

>>Fasting
Produces energy
Improve memory
It takes a while for body to adapylt
5:2 fasting - eat 300k cals on 2 days of fasting,

8 weeks of daily meditation enhance brain size
