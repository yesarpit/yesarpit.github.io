## Who is Mature?

Mature person is the one who owns to his or other actions and tries to fix it rather complain about it.

## Why to be mature
Understand this with an example 
I ordered a room cooler with online store croma.com, the cooler wasn't working hence i asked for replacement, the pick up man came and bluntly said they only pick packed boxex. 
The tone was so rude that I immediately replied him that I was not informed about this before, hence he left and i shut the door.

A week passed and still i was struggling to get my cooler pickedup.

If I had shown maturity at the time of first visit I could have enjoyed writing this blog sitting in front of Havells Tuono 18 Litres Personal Air Cooler (Thermal Overload Protection, GHRACBCW180, Mint Blue)
