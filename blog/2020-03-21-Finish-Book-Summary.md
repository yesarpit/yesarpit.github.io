## FINISH : a practical guide to get rid of perfectionism trap

"One goal at a time"

1) Choose what to bomb
 write a not-to-do list of things that are distracting you from achieving this one goal 

2) Make it fun if you want it done
two things are important in achieving goals
a. satisfaction
b. performance success

   To enjoy the process there are two motivatio
> Reward motivation : jaise ki body banane pe gf milegi
> Fear motivation : jaise ki mota hone pe health kharab hogi

Identify important factor which motivates you and use that to enjoy the process of achieving goals

3)  Leave your hiding places and ignore noble obstacles
> hiding place - is an activity you focus on instead of your goal
> noble obstacle - eg: i am waiting for good quality camera before start a shoot etc

DONE IS BETTER THAN PERFECT
Chase progress than perfection 

What ever you want to do, publish first version - however bad it may be - and then keep improving it , but its really really required to get the first work done.

so
1) make not to do list
2) enjoy journey
3) get rid of intelligent excuses
