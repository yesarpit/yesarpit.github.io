LAW OF IRRATIONALITY: Master Your Emotional Self\\n\\n    Humans think that we\u2019re rational and in control of our lives, when in reality we\u2019re driven by irrational emotions. We\u2019re often guided by our emotional impulses\u2014we seek pleasure, avoid pain and do things to soothe our ego.\\n\\n    Emotions and conscious thought are located in different parts of the brain\u2014we first feel an emotion before we interpret it consciously (and often wrongly). It\u2019s easier to think that you\u2019re angry with someone because he\u2019s a jerk, than to admit that you\u2019re insecure and jealous of him. In short, we\u2019re emotional creatures, yet we\u2019re often blind to our own impulses. Become aware of your own irrationality, then train yourself to learn and manage them through introspection and reflection.\\n\\n    Digest these powerful ideas in minutes with our full summary & infographic!\\n\\n    *BECOMING MORE RATIONAL*\\n    To become more rational, incorporate these 3 steps into your life:\\n\\n\u2022 Recognize biases (or \u201clow-grade irrationality\u201d) that distort your perception and responses. These include the (i) confirmation bias (thinking you\u2019re being logical when you\u2019re focusing on evidence to confirm your own beliefs), (ii) conviction bias (defending your views with conviction to drown out your doubts), (iii) appearance bias (thinking you can read people when you\u2019re misled by them), (iv) group bias (thinking your ideas are original when you\u2019re following the herd), (v) superiority bias (thinking you\u2019re better and more rational than others) and (vi) blame bias (avoiding your own failures and blaming others).\\n\\n\u2022 Beware of inflaming factors (or \u201chigh-grade irrationality\u201d) which call up certain feelings and intensify them. These may come from (i) childhood memories that trigger strong positive/negative feelings, (ii) sudden gains/losses that bring extreme optimism or pessimism, (iii) extreme stress which causes us to get defensive, (iv) individuals who evoke strong feelings in us/others, and (v) infectious emotions from large groups. Watch out for these factors, detach yourself and contemplate the underlying sources.\\n\\n\u2022 Develop your rational self: (i) observe yourself in times of stress, (ii) examine the roots of your feelings and record your observations, (iii) wait before you respond, (iv) accept irrational people as facts of life (vs taking things personally), and (iv) consciously channel your emotional energy instead of being driven by them.\\n\\n2. LAW OF NARCISSISM: Transform Self-Love into Empathy\\nHumans possess the natural ability to empathize and connect with others. Unfortunately, we get blinded by self-absorption. Our sense of self-worth is tied to the attention we receive and the quality of our interactions. The problem arises when we rely on others\u2019 attention and validation to feel worthy and alive.\\n\\nWe are all narcissists to varying degrees. Deep narcissists lack a cohesive sense of self, so their self-worth comes entirely from others\u2019 attention and validation. They tend to take everything personally, demand control and attention in their relationships and are expert manipulators as leaders. Most of us are functional narcissists in the middle of the spectrum. We may slip into moments of self-absorption, but have a strong-enough sense of self to pull out of it. Healthy narcissists have a strong, resilient sense of self. They direct their sensitivity outward\u2014in the form of empathy toward people or focused creativity in their work\u2014instead of inward.\\n\\nSHIFT TOWARD HEALTHY NARCISSISM\\nAim to (i) recognize deep narcissism to avoid being sucked into toxic relationships, (ii) be honest about your true nature, and (iii) shift toward healthy narcissism by developing 4 empathic skills:\\n\\n\u2022 Empathetic attitude: Assume you\u2019re ignorant about people and be truly curious about their point of view. In your daily conversations, (i) set aside your judgments/biases, (ii) stop your inner dialogue and listen fully, (iii) don\u2019t assume you have similar/shared views, and (iv) be open to new discoveries.\\n\\n\u2022 Visceral empathy: Pay attention to people\u2019s reactions, e.g. facial expressions, body language and tone of voice. Use mirroring to develop a stronger connection, e.g. mimic their tone or expression, nod and smile as you listen.\\n\\n\u2022 Analytic empathy: gather info about the other person to know them (e.g. family relationships, values, emotional triggers).\\n\\n\u2022 Use direct/indirect feedback to develop your empathetic skills: ask about their thoughts/feelings to verify your guesses, and observe their responses and rapport.\\n\\n   \\n3. Law of Role Playing: See though people\u2019s masks.  Become a master at reading people and presenting yourself optimally with 3 skills.\\n\\n4. Law of Compulsive Behavior: Know people\u2019s character. When choosing who to work/associate with, learn to look beyond appearances. Learn to assess your own character (so you can address the negative patterns in your life) and becoming skilled at reading others\u2019 character.\\n\\n5. Law of Covetousness: Become an elusive object of desire. It\u2019s human tendency to covet what we don\u2019t have. Learn and apply the 3 strategies for stimulating desire.\\n\\n6. Law of Shortsightedness: Elevate your perspective. Learn to step back and consider the bigger picture instead of reacting to what\u2019s in front of you. Recognize and overcome the 4 signs of shortsightedness.\\n\\n7. Law of Defensiveness: Confirm people\u2019s self-opinion. To influence someone, don\u2019t try to show how good you are nor challenge them directly. Instead, use 5 strategies to soften their defenses (by validating their self-opinion and aligning your idea with it).\\n\\n8. Law of Self-sabotage: Your attitude shapes your situation. Our attitude affects how we interpret and respond to events/people, thus creating a self-fulfilling effect. Overcome 5 constricted attitudes and embrace expansive ones, to improve your circumstances.\\n\\n9. Law of Repression: Confront your dark side. We all have a dark side (e.g. the selfish, greedy, or aggressive parts of ourselves) that we hide in order to fit in and be liked/respected. Recognize the 7 common emphatic traits that hide a darker side, and use 4 steps to tap on your full range of creative energies and become an integrated human.\\n\\n10. Law of Envy: Beware the fragile ego. Humans constantly compare ourselves with one another, and deny our own envy/jealousy. Learn to decode and diffuse envy before it turns dangerous. Learn the signs of envy, the 5 envier types, the situations that often trigger active envy, and how to build your self-worth.\\n\\n11. Law of Grandiosity: Know your limits. Humans want to think highly of ourselves, to the point we tend to imagine our superiority. Learn to identify the signs of elevated grandiosity in yourself and in others, including the 6 common illusions of grandiose leaders and how you can adopt practical grandiosity.\\n\\n12. Law of Gender Rigidity: Reconnect to your masculinity/femininity. Every human has both masculine and feminine qualities genes, and hormones. Learn to recognize 6 types of gender projections and unlock your repressed qualities/energy to become more flexible, balanced and effective.\\n\\n13. Law of Aimlessness: Advance with a sense of purpose. Use 5 strategies to overcome in-the-moment impulses to develop a sense of purpose and follow your inner compass.\\n\\n14. Law of Conformity: Resist the groups\u2019 downward pull. We like to believe that we\u2019re independent and progressive, but we can\u2019t help conforming with our groups. Develop group intelligence by knowing how you\u2019re individually influenced by groups and recognize the dynamics/patterns found in any group, then use 5 strategies to develop healthy groups with an upward pull.\\n\\n15. Law of Fickleness: Make them want to follow you. We want to believe that our emotions are pure and simple, when we\u2019re actually ambivalent toward most things, including our leaders. Learn to establish your authority with 8 strategies and cultivate your inner authority.\\n\\n16. Law of Aggression: See the hostility behind the fa\xe7ade. On the surface, people seem friendly and civilized. But beneath the mask, everyone has an aggressive side. Learn to recognize and manage chronic aggressors, counter passive-aggression, be aware of your own aggressive tendencies, and harness 4 positive aspects of your assertive energy.\\n\\n17. Law of Generational Myopia: Seize the historical moment. We\u2019re strongly defined by the generation that we\u2019re born into. Realize how history moves in cycles across 4 generations, understand how your generation\u2019s spirit affects you, and how/where you fit in the wider generational patterns. Then, use several strategies to exploit the spirit of the times.\\n\\n18. Law of Death Denial: Contemplate common mortality. Instead of avoiding thoughts of death, leverage the paradoxical death effect\u2013use the awareness of your mortality to make your life more productive and meaningful.\\n\\n\\nSO these were the 18 laws.
