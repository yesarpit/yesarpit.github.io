                        <h1>The SVG grid system considers top left as its default position</h1>
                        <p class="date-holder">Posted 11<sup>th</sup>January 2018</p>
                        <h3>Is that a big deal? </h3>
                        <p>
                            Yes? Because since kids we were taught that 0,0 starts at bottom left and that is how we draw graphs all over. But cruel
                            HTML engines draws its page starting from top left as 0,0 and then calculates pixels accordingly.
                        </p>
                        As per <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Positions">mdn</a>:
                        <div class="quote-container">
                            <q class="quote-text"><i>
                                For all elements, SVG uses a coordinate system or grid system..That is, the top left corner of the document is considered to be the point (0,0), or point of origin
                                </i>
                        </q>

                        </div>

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Did that change your perception a bit? I did mine. I spent couple of hours figuring out why my d3 was plotting graphs from top left.
                            wish I had know this before.

                        <h3>Static Keyword ?? What exactly? </h3>
                        <p>
                            The keyword static is used , so that method could be directly accessible from class instead of its instance. if static keyword
                            is not used, method will only be accessible from instance. and vice-versa

                        <h1>New elements in HTML5</h1>
                        <p class="date-holder">Posted 05<sup>th</sup>Dec 2016</p>
                        <h3>Why are we even talking about it?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Itâ€™s 2016 and are we still discussing HTML5 new elements? Hell yes. Prime reason being I had this page of new elements in
                            my age old notebook which I don't want to throw away hence putting this on Blog would save it
                            from my family who always want to throw away my stationery. Now let me give you some lame reasons
                            why would this be of interest to anyone:
                            <ol>
                                <li> If you land up appearing for an Interview with big Indian IT
                                    <del>labor factory</del> MNC, chances are that Interviewer would still be amazed with how
                                    HTML5 changed the world and might ask you about a few new elements.</li>
                                <li>If you are just starting with web development this would help you show off ðŸ˜Ž your knowledge
                                    to clients, especially in a board room where instead of drawing layout you draw tag names
                                    on board like
                                    <code>
                                        &lt;header&gt; &lt;video&gt; &lt;time&gt; &lt;keygen&gt; &lt;mark&gt;
                                    </code> etc.
                                </li>
                                <li> If someone really cares about semantic web and by any chance would want to follow what W3C
                                    preaches.
                                </li>
                                <li>..(I can't find any more reasons)</li>
                                <li>.(eom)</li>
                            </ol>
                            </br>
                            As you can see there are five compelling reasons still someone would be interested in learning new HTML elements, so here
                            I present the hidden treasure from my cheap old notebook :
                            </br>
                        </p>
                        <div class="image-container">
                            <img src="assets/images/newhtml5elements.jpg" width=500 height=910 class="img-responsive" style="margin:auto">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <br> Hope it helps.

                        <p class="date-holder">Posted 05<sup>th</sup>April 2016</p>
                        <h3>Beginner's Trouble</h3>
                        <p>
                            Being a UI Developer is not an easy job, it often makes you wonder if you should follow the best practices or stay with whatever
                            gets your job done quickly. While marking up this Blog I was faced with a challenge of using
                            semantics over traditional div's. I decided to go with semantics. </p>
                        <p>Now to follow semantics, I thought W3C HTML5 specs would help me. But, Its an overdose of information
                            for a regular UI developer like me. I then moved to WHATWG's live standard, though it's better
                            than W3C but its still a lot of information to digest.</p>
                        <em> Do you understand this:</em>
                        <div class="quote-container">
                            <q class="quote-text"><i>The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content. The theme of each section should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the section element.</i></q>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Frankly above dint made much sense to me. I need either a one liner explanation or a real world example. Thankfully I found
                            an article on iandevlin's blog which has a nice analogy of newspaper section and articles. A
                            newspaper has many sections like Politics, Finance , Editorial - which I avoid reading. A section
                            may contain a few articles like "Minister A said xxx to Minister B" and "Minister B found roaming
                            with A's wife" etc. A section can contain many articles and now the weired part: article may
                            contain more sections followed by more articles.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            Nevertheless the newspaper analogy gives us a clear picture and easy to understand pattern for our use. Below is how I arranged
                            my sections :
                        </p>

                        <h1>Difference between HTML4 & HTML5</h1>
                        <p class="date-holder">Posted 28<sup>th</sup>December 2015</p>
                        <h3>1. HTML5 Is a Work in Progress </h3>
                        <p>
                            As cool as it is to see what HTML5 can do for you, it hasn&#39;t been standardized like HTML4. You don&#39;t have to worry
                            about updating pages built using HTML4. It&#39;s more than ten years old and it&#39;s a set standard.
                            If you jump into HTML5 with both feet, you&#39;re going to be making updates. Elements and attributes
                            are added and modified several times a year. Of course, this is dependent how much you depend
                            on rich elements, but it&#39;s certainly a risk you must take into consideration when using a
                            fluid language. Build with HTML4, play with HTML5.
                        </p>
                        <h3>2. Simplified Syntax </h3> The simpler doctype declaration is just one of the many novelties in HTML5.
                        Now you need to write only:
                        <!doctype html> and this is it. The syntax of HTML5 is compatible with HTML4 and XHTML1, but not with SGML.
                        <h3>3. The New &lt;canvas&gt; Element </h3> This is what killed Flash. Although it isn&#39;t as â€¦ uh
                        â€¦ flashy â€¦ most assume that it will eventually make Flash obsolete. Only time will tell.
                        <h3>4. The &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; Elements </h3> For good or bad, HTML5 has acknowledged the
                        new web anatomy. With HTML5, &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; are specifically marked for such.
                        Because of this, it is unnecessary to identify these two elements with a &lt;div&gt; tag.
                        <h3>5. New &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; Elements </h3> Again, HTML5 has adopted the popular web
                        standard. &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; allows you to mark specific areas of your layout as
                        such, and should have a positive effect on on your SEO in the end.
                        <h3>6. New &lt;menu&gt; and &lt;figure&gt; Elements </h3> &lt;menu&lt; can be used for your main menu,
                        but it can also be used for toolbars and context menus. The &lt;figure&gt; element is another way
                        to arrange text and images.
                        <h3>7. New &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; Elements </h3> Embedind audio and video has never been easier.
                        There are also some new multimedia elements and attributes, such as &lt;track&gt;, that provides
                        text tracks for the video element. With these additions HTML5 is definitely getting more and more
                        Web 2.0-friendly. The problem is that by the time HTML5 becomes widely accepted, Web 2.0 might be
                        old news.
                        <h3>8. New Forms</h3> The new &lt;form&gt; and &lt;forminput&gt; elements are looking good. If you do
                        much with forms, you may want to take a look at what these have to offer.
                        <h3>9. Kiss &lt;b&gt; and &lt;font&gt; Goodbye!</h3> CSS, all the time. All the time, CSS.
