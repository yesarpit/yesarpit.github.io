  <h1>Difference between HTML4 & HTML5</h1>
  <p>28th December 2015<p>

  

 <h3>1. HTML5 Is a Work in Progress </h3>
<p>
As cool as it is to see what HTML5 can do for you, it hasn&#39;t been standardized like HTML4. You don&#39;t have to worry about updating pages built using HTML4. It&#39;s more than ten years old and it&#39;s a set standard.

If you jump into HTML5 with both feet, you&#39;re going to be making updates. Elements and attributes are added and modified several times a year. Of course, this is dependent how much you depend on rich elements, but it&#39;s certainly a risk you must take into consideration when using a fluid language.

Build with HTML4, play with HTML5.
</p>
<h3>2. Simplified Syntax </h3>

The simpler doctype declaration is just one of the many novelties in HTML5. Now you need to write only: <!doctype html> and this is it. The syntax of HTML5 is compatible with HTML4 and XHTML1, but not with SGML.

<h3>3. The New &lt;canvas&gt; Element </h3>

This is what killed Flash.

Although it isn&#39;t as … uh … flashy … most assume that it will eventually make Flash obsolete.

Only time will tell.

<h3>4. The &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; Elements </h3>

For good or bad, HTML5 has acknowledged the new web anatomy. With HTML5, &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; are specifically marked for such. Because of this, it is unnecessary to identify these two elements with a &lt;div&gt; tag.

<h3>5. New &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; Elements </h3>

Again, HTML5 has adopted the popular web standard. &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; allows you to mark specific areas of your layout as such, and should have a positive effect on on your SEO in the end.

<h3>6. New &lt;menu&gt; and &lt;figure&gt; Elements </h3>

&lt;menu&lt; can be used for your main menu, but it can also be used for toolbars and context menus. The &lt;figure&gt; element is another way to arrange text and images.

<h3>7. New &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; Elements </h3>

Embedind audio and video has never been easier.

There are also some new multimedia elements and attributes, such as &lt;track&gt;, that provides text tracks for the video element. With these additions HTML5 is definitely getting more and more Web 2.0-friendly. The problem is that by the time HTML5 becomes widely accepted, Web 2.0 might be old news.

<h3>8. New Forms</h3>

The new &lt;form&gt; and &lt;forminput&gt; elements are looking good. If you do much with forms, you may want to take a look at what these have to offer. 

<h3>9. Kiss &lt;b&gt; and &lt;font&gt; Goodbye!</h3>

CSS, all the time.

All the time, CSS.
