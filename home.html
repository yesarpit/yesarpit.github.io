      <h3>Beginner's Trouble</h3>
      <p>
        Being a UI Developer is not an easy job, it often makes you wonder if you should follow the best practices or stay with whatever gets your job done quickly. 

        While marking up this Blog I was faced with a challenge of using semantics over traditional div's. I decided to go with semantics. 
        </br>
        </br>
        Now, to follow semantics, I thought W3C HTML5 specs would help me. But, Its an overdose of information for a regular UI developer like me. I then moved to WHATWG's live standard, though it's better than W3C but its still a lot of information to digest.</p>

        <em> Do you understand this:</em>

          <div class="quote-container">
            <q class="quote-text"><i>The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content. The theme of each section should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the section element.</i></q>
          </div>

      <p>
        Frankly above dint made much sense to me. I need either a one liner explanation or a real world example. Thankfully I found an article on iandevlin's blog which has a nice analogy of newspaper section and articles.

        A newspaper has many sections like Politics, Finance , Editorial - which I avoid reading.
        A section may contain  a few articles like "Minister A said xxx to Minister B" and "Minister B found roaming with A's wife" etc.  

        A section can contain many articles and now the weired part: article may contain more sections followed by more articles. 
        </br>
        </br>
        Nevertheless the newspaper analogy gives us a clear picture and easy to understand pattern for our use.

        Below is how I arranged my sections :
        </p>

      Hope it helps.

          <h1>Difference between HTML4 & HTML5</h1>
          <p class="date-holder">Posted 28<sup>th</sup>December 2015</p>



           <h3>1. HTML5 Is a Work in Progress </h3>
           <p>
            As cool as it is to see what HTML5 can do for you, it hasn&#39;t been standardized like HTML4. You don&#39;t have to worry about updating pages built using HTML4. It&#39;s more than ten years old and it&#39;s a set standard.

            If you jump into HTML5 with both feet, you&#39;re going to be making updates. Elements and attributes are added and modified several times a year. Of course, this is dependent how much you depend on rich elements, but it&#39;s certainly a risk you must take into consideration when using a fluid language.

            Build with HTML4, play with HTML5.
          </p>
          <h3>2. Simplified Syntax </h3>

          The simpler doctype declaration is just one of the many novelties in HTML5. Now you need to write only: <!doctype html> and this is it. The syntax of HTML5 is compatible with HTML4 and XHTML1, but not with SGML.

          <h3>3. The New &lt;canvas&gt; Element </h3>

          This is what killed Flash.

          Although it isn&#39;t as … uh … flashy … most assume that it will eventually make Flash obsolete.

          Only time will tell.

          <h3>4. The &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; Elements </h3>

          For good or bad, HTML5 has acknowledged the new web anatomy. With HTML5, &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt; are specifically marked for such. Because of this, it is unnecessary to identify these two elements with a &lt;div&gt; tag.

          <h3>5. New &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; Elements </h3>

          Again, HTML5 has adopted the popular web standard. &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; allows you to mark specific areas of your layout as such, and should have a positive effect on on your SEO in the end.

          <h3>6. New &lt;menu&gt; and &lt;figure&gt; Elements </h3>

          &lt;menu&lt; can be used for your main menu, but it can also be used for toolbars and context menus. The &lt;figure&gt; element is another way to arrange text and images.

          <h3>7. New &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; Elements </h3>

          Embedind audio and video has never been easier.

          There are also some new multimedia elements and attributes, such as &lt;track&gt;, that provides text tracks for the video element. With these additions HTML5 is definitely getting more and more Web 2.0-friendly. The problem is that by the time HTML5 becomes widely accepted, Web 2.0 might be old news.

          <h3>8. New Forms</h3>

          The new &lt;form&gt; and &lt;forminput&gt; elements are looking good. If you do much with forms, you may want to take a look at what these have to offer. 

          <h3>9. Kiss &lt;b&gt; and &lt;font&gt; Goodbye!</h3>

          CSS, all the time.

          All the time, CSS.
